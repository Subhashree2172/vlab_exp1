## Aim:
The experiments open up the introduction to types of signal and their representations.
In this experiment, the students can visualize the signal and measure their parameters,namely peak-peak value, RMS value, average value, period, frequency.

They can also analyze the signal behavior using CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope).
